# RPF Landing Dashboard

This is a dash app that contains a landing page and an overview dashboard used as an entry point for the country-specific Re-imagining Public Finance (RPF) dashboard.

## Development

First `git clone` this repo.

Get connection details for the SQL Warehouse compute resource which is used for providing the database connection: https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/compute-details.html
Contact the maintainers of this repo for databricks client ID and secret.

Create `.env` from `.env.example` and the obtained information:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with the obtained information
```


Then to setup and verify the app works locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
dotenv run - python app.py
open http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```
You should see the data app.


## Deployment

- Internal Server: https://w0lxdrconn01.worldbank.org
- External Server: https://w0lxdshyprd1c01.worldbank.org

Ensure you have an RStudio Connect account, if not [request here](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=ticket&table=sc_req_item&sys_id=fbb93028476502d09169d03fe16d4309). Upon account provisioning, generate API key(s) on the target server's UI.

Check which python version is supported by the server with:

```bash
rsconnect content search --server [server URL] --api-key [your API key] | jq -c '.[] | {}' | sort | uniq
```

As of writing both the internal and external server supports 3.8.14 so that's the version we are going to use for building & deploying the dash app. If you are using `pyenv` this repo's python version has configured to use 3.8.14. If the target server uses a different version, feel free to switch using `pyenv local 3.x.x`.


Add your RStudio Connect API key (one-time action):

```bash
rsconnect add --server https://w0lxdshyprd1c01.worldbank.org --api-key [your API key] --name prod
```

To deploy:

```bash
rsconnect deploy dash --name prod ./
```
